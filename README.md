# Project Description:
Conducted an in-depth analysis of retail data to predict stock requirements for the next two weeks, leveraging various data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building to prevent understocking scenarios.

**Key Points:**

**Business Planning and Strategy:**
Developed a comprehensive business plan to address stock management challenges and prevent understocking scenarios in the retail environment.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Implemented data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the retail dataset for analysis, ensuring data quality and integrity.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Conducted comprehensive EDA on historical sales data to understand trends, patterns, and relationships between variables.
Analyzed features such as base price, display, feature, and store characteristics to identify factors influencing item demand.

**Feature Engineering:**
Engineered new features from the raw data to capture important information relevant to stock prediction, enhancing the predictive power of the model.

**Feature Selection:**
Selected relevant features for model training based on correlation analysis, domain knowledge, and feature importance techniques.

**Model Building:**
Built predictive models using various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree to forecast stock requirements for the next two weeks.

**Training and Validation Sets:**
Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance and ensure robustness of the predictions.

**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of stock predictions.
